## About
OctaOut is a fast-paced wacky physics stealth game about an octopus escaping a sushi restaurant, where your fingers are the controls! Sugoi!

Play as a cute octopus named Tako and escape a sushi restaurant to avoid becoming lunch! The key is to sneak out of the restaurant by hiding behind and in objects, crawling into containers, and avoiding enemies and dangerous object! Essentially, you qwop your way out. The added fun is that you really are Tako--using flex sensors and Arduino<-->Unity communication, you control each of Tako's tentacles with the bending of your fingers! Good luck, and don't become this week's special! (And yes, basically this is octopus qwop with a few extra steps, @ me Bennett Foddy.)
