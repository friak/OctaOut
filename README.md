# OctaOut
Alternative input stealth game about an octopus escaping a sushi restaurant.

## The pitch
The player is a cute octopus that is trying to escape a sushi restaurant and avoid becoming lunch! The goal of the level is to sneak out of the restaurant by hiding behind objects, crawling into containers, and essentially qwoping your way out. The added fun is that you really are the octopus--by controlling its tentacles with the movement of your fingers! The way this works is that the alt. controller is a set of gloves that uses flex sensors to sense how the player curls their fingers and thus curling and moving the tentacles of the octopus. So yes, octopus qwop, @ me Bennett Foddy.

## Possible design goals
Alternative Controller
Stealth
Funny physics that isn't too difficult

## Super tentative timeline

wk1: Create a prototype model of octopus, connect physical computing data to unity (I've done arduino->unity serial communication before, and am confident in my 3D modeling skills, so I find this to be a good first step!) I'll also be doing some level design sketching, and I want to start off as simple as possible and build more complexity to the level based on do-ability through assessing my progress in these next few weeks. 

wk2: Use flex sensors to test out moving octopus legs (understanding how the incoming data from arduino moves the rigged limbs; using incoming data is good, rigging the limbs is ahhh). Further level design developing as well.

wk3: MAKE OR BREAK WEEK. If I can't get the sensors to work, I will figure out a different way of controlling the octopus whether it's a different method of alternative input or using traditional controllers.

wk4: Prototype of level and playing around with the physics and movement of the octopus with the determined controller. If very successful, I want to play around with other elements of physics like squishiness of the ocotpus and/or water.

wk5: Start to really tweak bugs and gameplay; is the gameplay fun? Is it too easy or too difficult? Add more or less to the level? etc.

wk6: ADD THE jUiCe- music, sound effects, added animation, art, basically all the fun work.

wk7: Finish the game a week early (or at least aim for that so I have an entire extra week when things end up defnitely falling apart).

wk8: Fix everything that definitely fell apart.
