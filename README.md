Alternative input stealth game about an octopus escaping a sushi restaurant.

## The idea and core mechanics
The player is a cute octopus that is trying to escape a sushi restaurant and avoid becoming lunch! The goal of the level is to sneak out of the restaurant by hiding behind objects, crawling into containers, and essentially qwoping your way out. The added fun is that you really are the octopus--by controlling its tentacles with the movement of your fingers! The way this works is that the alt. controller is a set of gloves that uses flex sensors to sense how the player curls their fingers and thus curling and moving the tentacles of the octopus. So yes, octopus qwop, @ me Bennett Foddy.
